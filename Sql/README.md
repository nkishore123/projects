# Querying on Superstore data

The superstore dataset can be downloaded from google, which contains 3 sheets orders,returns and people
We have to separate these three sheets to different csv files and we should import them into mysql workbench.

After doing that we can do whatever we want with those tables, we can join them we can perform different types of queries

In this file we got answers for 3 different queries and created stored procedure for that.
